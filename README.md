    IF YOU USE ANY SCRIPTS FROM THIS PROJECT, OR MAKE AN EDIT, LEAVE CREDIT.

    NOTE:
        I Can Without A Doubt Say Apparition Will Be Unmatched In Every Possible Way.
        It Will Be The Most Stable, In-Depth, Detail Oriented, Organized, and Largest Mod Menu You Will Ever See.
        I Have Spent Countless Hours Over The Years Getting Apparition To Where It Is, Which Includes On Other Games As Well(Newer and Older).

        You Won't Find Anything That Will Be Comparable To Apparition, Not Even The Menus With "Devs" That Constantly Have To Rip Scripts From Apparition For Their Projects.
        Apparition Will Remain On Top, Regardless Of Who Tries To Compete With It.

        Since There Has Been Confusion and Accusations, Apparition(including the base) Belongs To Me(CF4_99) and Me Only. I have built it 100%, from the ground up.
        I Am The Sole Developer Of Apparition, No One Else Helps With it, Or Provides Scripts.
        The Credits Below Says Exactly What These People Offered Apparition, Nothing More, Nothing Less.


    Credits:
        - CF4_99 ~ Project Developer
        - Extinct ~ Ideas, Suggestions, Constructive Criticism, and His Spec-Nade
        - CraftyCritter ~ BO3 Compiler
        - ItsFebiven ~ Some Ideas and Suggestions
        - Joel ~ Suggestions, Bug Reports, and Testing The Unique String Crash Protection


    Custom Maps:
        While I have tested Apparition a lot on custom maps, you may run into some issues with a few options not working 100% as they should.

        Known Issues On Custom Maps(Ones that can't, or won't, be fixed):

            Weaponry - Not all weapons are in the right category(Also applies to custom weapon mods):
                ~ I am aware of this. There isn't anything I can do about it. Most of them, if not all, are moved into the 'Specials' Category.


    Map EE Options:
        I have created scripts to complete the EE's for the classic maps that have smaller EE's.
        As for the bigger maps that have bigger and more complex EE's, I have made scripts to make completing the EE's, a lot easier.
        The EE scripts will complete steps properly, not just set flags/variables tricking the game into thinking the step is completed, when it actually hasn't(unlike other "developers")
        This will prevent any issues with crashes/conflictions later on while continuing regular gameplay/playing through other parts of the EE.

        Where to find options that help completing EE's:
            Main Menu -> [map name] Scripts
            Server Modifications -> Craftables
        
    Craftables:
        Not all craftables will be found in the Craftables menu
        Some craftables have to be added and collected manually
        So if you can't find a craftable in the Craftables menu, check the map scripts menu
        If it's not found in Craftables, or the map scripts menu, then it's a craftable that would have to be added manually, and I haven't made a script to collect the parts yet


    If you find any bugs, or come across something that you feel isn't working as it should, please message me on discord.
