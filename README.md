    Apparition has been in development for a long time(too long).
    While I haven't spent every second of every day on this project, a lot of time and work has gone into it.
    Every step of the way, I have tried to make it one of the biggest, and best menus for BO3 Zombies.
    I have spent countless hours not only developing, but also bug testing every option in this menu.
    While I don't think it will ever officially be finished, I thought it was in a good state to be released.

    While I do test everything I add, or change, there are probably things I have missed.
    If you come across any bugs, please message me on discord.



    Custom Maps:
        While I have tested Apparition a lot on custom maps, you may run into some issues with a few options not working 100% as they should.

        Known Issues On Custom Maps(Ones that can't, or won't, be fixed):

            Weaponry - Not all weapons are in the right category(Also applies to custom weapon mods):
                ~ I am aware of this. There isn't anything I can do about it. Most of them, if not all, are moved into the 'Specials' Category.



    Map EE Options:
        I have created scripts to complete the EE's for the classic maps that have smaller EE's.
        As for the bigger maps that have bigger and more complex EE's, I have made scripts to make completing the EE's, a lot easier.
        The reason for me not adding an option to complete the whole EE for bigger maps, isn't because I can't do it.
        It saves myself time, which I don't have a lot of.

        If I missed something that would help with EE's, or you just want to request a USEFUL script, feel free to message me on discord.

        Where to find options that help completing EE's:
            Main Menu -> [map name] Scripts
            Server Modifications -> Craftables
        
        Whole EE's Completed:
            - The Giant
            - Nacht Der Untoten
            - Verruckt
            - Shi No Numa
            - Kino Der Toten



    If you find any bugs, or come across something that you feel isn't working as it should, please message me on discord.
